          <div class="faq__q">Which AI platforms does this work for?</div>
          <div class="faq__a">Our AEO system targets all major AI answer engines: ChatGPT (5+ billion monthly visits), Perplexity (500+ million monthly queries), Google Gemini and AI Overviews (appearing on 15%+ of searches), Claude by Anthropic, and Microsoft Copilot. The strategy works across all platforms because they all prioritize the same trust signals: structured data, authoritative citations, and clean factual information.</div>

        <div class="faq__item">
          <div class="faq__q">What kind of businesses benefit from AEO?</div>
          <div class="faq__a">Any business where potential customers ask AI for recommendations. E-commerce brands, SaaS companies, professional services, local businesses, health and wellness brands, financial services, B2B companies. If people are asking AI "what is the best [your category]," you need AEO.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq__item">
          <div class="faq__q">How do you measure AEO success?</div>
          <div class="faq__a">We track three core KPIs: recommendation share (how many target queries you're #1 for), AI referral traffic volume, and AI referral conversion rate. We run your target queries through ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other platforms weekly and report exactly where you stand versus competitors.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq__item">
          <div class="faq__q">Why is the conversion rate so much higher from AI traffic?</div>
          <div class="faq__a">When ChatGPT tells someone "this is the best [product] for [their need]," they arrive at your site pre-sold. The AI already did the comparison shopping for them. They don't browse 10 tabs or read 20 reviews. They trust the recommendation and buy. That's why AI-referred traffic converts at 4.4x the rate of traditional Google organic traffic.</div>
