Unlike traditional SEO which targets search engine rankings, AEO focuses on becoming the direct answer AI gives to users.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq__item">
          <div class="faq__q">How is AEO different from SEO?</div>
          <div class="faq__a">SEO optimizes for search engine result pages where you compete as one of 10 blue links. AEO optimizes for AI answer engines where there is typically only one recommendation, maybe three. SEO targets keywords and rankings.

          <div class="faq__a">We monitor your AI recommendation share: how often you appear when customers ask AI platforms about your industry. We run your target queries across ChatGPT, Meta AI, Gemini, and Perplexity regularly and report exactly where you stand versus competitors.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq__item">
          <div class="faq__q">Why is AI referral traffic so valuable?</div>
          <div class="faq__a">When an AI tells someone "this is the best [product] for [their need]," they arrive at your site pre-sold. The AI already did the comparison shopping for them. They don't browse 10 tabs or read 20 reviews. They trust the recommendation and act on it. That's why businesses optimized for AI visibility consistently see higher-quality leads from these channels.</div>
