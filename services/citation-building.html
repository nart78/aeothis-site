      <!-- TL;DR -->
      <div class="tldr-box animate-on-scroll">
        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <p>Third-party citation building is the process of getting your brand mentioned, reviewed, and referenced on external websites that AI trusts. AI assistants do not just read your website. They cross-reference what others say about you. Review sites, comparison articles, Wikidata entries, Reddit discussions, and industry directories all contribute to AI recommendation decisions. External validation is one of the strongest signals for AI recommendations.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- What Is Citation Building for AEO? -->
      <h2>What Is Citation Building for AEO?</h2>
      <p>Citation building for AEO means getting your brand mentioned on the external sources that AI cites when making recommendations. This is fundamentally different from traditional link building for SEO.</p>
      <p>AEO citation building focuses on the specific platforms AI trusts most: review sites (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot), structured data sources (Wikidata), community platforms (Reddit, Quora), and comparison articles. The goal is not a backlink. The goal is a mention on a source that AI already reads and trusts. Each citation makes the next recommendation more likely.</p>

      <!-- Why It Matters -->
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI trusts third-party opinions more than first-party claims.</strong> A review on G2 saying "best project management tool for small teams" carries more weight than your own website saying the same thing. AI models are trained to recognize the difference between self-promotion and independent validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Perplexity specifically shows its citation sources.</strong> Multiple third-party references mean stronger, more confident recommendations. When Perplexity cites three external sources that all mention your brand positively, the recommendation is far more convincing to the user.</li>
        <li><strong>The compound effect is powerful.</strong> When AI sees your brand mentioned positively across review sites, comparison articles, Reddit, and Wikidata, the cumulative impact drives consistent recommendations. One citation is a data point. Ten citations from different source types become a pattern AI trusts.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party citations create a defensive moat.</strong> Even if a competitor has a great website, they cannot fake third-party citations. Building genuine reviews, community credibility, and Wikidata entries takes time and sustained effort. Early movers lock in an advantage that compounds over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Our Process -->
      <h2>Our Process</h2>

      <div class="process__steps">
        <div class="process__step animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="process__step-num">1</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Citation Source Identification</h3>
            <p>We identify the top sources AI cites in your category: review sites, comparison platforms, Wikidata, Reddit, Quora, niche forums, directories, and authoritative blogs. Different AI platforms weight different sources, so we map which sources matter most for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude in your specific industry.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="process__step animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="process__step-num">2</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Review Site Presence</h3>
            <p>We ensure you have complete, accurate profiles on G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, BBB, and industry-specific review platforms. Each profile is optimized with detailed descriptions, accurate categories, and rich media. A half-filled profile signals neglect. A complete profile signals a business that takes its reputation seriously.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="process__step animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="process__step-num">3</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Wikidata Entry</h3>
            <p>We create or update your Wikidata entry with accurate structured data. Wikidata is one of the most frequently cited sources by AI assistants. It serves as a foundational knowledge base that AI uses to verify entity information. An accurate Wikidata entry tells AI that your company is a recognized, verified entity.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="process__step animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="process__step-num">4</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Community Mentions</h3>
            <p>We develop a strategy for organic mentions on Reddit, Quora, and niche forums. Every contribution must be genuine and helpful. AI can detect astroturfing, and so can the communities themselves. We focus on answering real questions with real expertise, contributing value in discussions where your product or service is genuinely relevant.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="process__step animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="process__step-num">5</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Comparison and Roundup Placement</h3>
            <p>We get your brand included in third-party "best of" lists, comparison articles, and industry roundups. These are the primary content types AI cites when making recommendations. When AI is asked "What is the best X for Y?", it looks for comparison articles that have already done the analysis.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="process__step animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="process__step-num">6</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Citation Monitoring</h3>
            <p>We continuously monitor where your brand is cited and where it is missing. New review sites, comparison articles, and community discussions in your category get covered as they appear. Citation building is not a one-time project. It is an ongoing effort that compounds over time.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- What You Get -->
      <h2>What You Get</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Citation source map</strong> showing where AI currently looks for validation in your category and where your gaps are</li>
        <li><strong>Complete and optimized profiles</strong> on the top review platforms AI trusts, including G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, BBB, and industry-specific sites</li>
        <li><strong>Wikidata entry creation or update</strong> with verified structured data that AI uses for entity confirmation</li>
        <li><strong>Community mention strategy</strong> with genuine, helpful contributions on Reddit, Quora, and relevant niche forums</li>
        <li><strong>Placement in third-party comparison articles</strong> and industry roundups that AI cites when making recommendations</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing citation monitoring</strong> with quarterly reports on citation growth, new source coverage, and recommendation impact</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Real-World Example -->
      <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
      <p>A cybersecurity company had strong technical content on their website but almost no third-party presence. AI assistants rarely recommended them because there was nothing to cross-reference. Their own website said they were great, but no external source confirmed it.</p>
      <p>We created a Wikidata entry, optimized their G2 and Capterra profiles, contributed genuine technical insights on relevant Reddit threads, and secured placement in 4 industry comparison articles. Within 8 weeks, Perplexity started citing their G2 reviews and comparison article mentions. Their AI recommendation rate went from 5 to 33 out of 50 target queries.</p>

      <!-- How This Connects -->
      <h2>How This Connects</h2>
      <p>Citation Building reinforces everything built in Layers 2 and 3. When your <a href="/services/answer-hub-creation.html">Answer Hub</a> claims you are the best in your category, third-party citations validate that claim. AI cross-references your website data against external sources. The more external sources confirm what your Answer Hub says, the more confidently AI recommends you.</p>
      <p><a href="/services/answer-intent-mapping.html">Layer 1 (Answer Intent Mapping)</a> identifies which third-party sources AI already trusts in your category. That intelligence drives the entire citation strategy, telling us exactly where to focus effort for maximum impact.</p>
