        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <p>Answer Intent Mapping is the first layer of the AEO system. It involves auditing 50+ real questions that potential customers ask AI assistants about your category, testing those queries across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude, and documenting which brands get recommended and why. The output is a competitive intelligence report that shows exactly where you stand in AI recommendations and a prioritized roadmap for improvement.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What Is Answer Intent Mapping?</h2>
      <p>Answer Intent Mapping is the research phase where you systematically document what questions people ask AI assistants about your category, which brands get recommended in response, what sources AI cites to justify those recommendations, and where the gaps are for your business.</p>
      <p>This is fundamentally different from keyword research in traditional SEO. Traditional keyword research looks at search volume and competition for specific terms. Answer intent mapping looks at conversational queries, comparison-based questions, and trust-weighted recommendation signals. When someone asks ChatGPT "What is the best project management tool for small teams?", the AI does not return ten blue links. It gives a direct recommendation, often citing specific sources. Answer intent mapping reveals the entire decision-making process behind that recommendation.</p>
      <p>The goal is simple: understand the landscape before you try to change it. You need to know which queries matter most, who currently owns those recommendations, and what specific content, data, and citations are driving those results.</p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>People are shifting from searching to asking.</strong> AI assistants do not show ten results. They give one recommendation, maybe two or three. If you are not the recommendation, your competitor is. There is no page two to fall back on.</li>
        <li><strong>Without knowing what people ask AI about your category, you are optimizing blind.</strong> You might be creating content for queries nobody asks, or missing the exact questions that drive purchase decisions. The audit eliminates guesswork.</li>
        <li><strong>Different AI platforms cite different sources.</strong> A brand that dominates ChatGPT recommendations might be completely invisible on Perplexity. Gemini pulls from different data than Claude. Testing across all platforms reveals the full picture.</li>
        <li><strong>The audit creates a measurable baseline.</strong> Without it, you cannot prove ROI. You need to know where you stand today so you can demonstrate improvement after implementing the remaining layers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Query Identification.</strong> We compile 50+ real questions that potential customers ask AI assistants about your category. These include product comparison queries ("What is the best X vs Y?"), recommendation queries ("What do you recommend for Z?"), specification questions ("Which X supports feature Y?"), and "best of" queries across every relevant angle. We use a combination of customer research, competitor analysis, and AI query pattern databases to build a comprehensive list.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Platform Testing.</strong> We run every query through ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, and Microsoft Copilot. Every response is documented in full, including which brands are mentioned, in what order, with what level of confidence, and what caveats the AI includes. We test multiple variations of each query to account for prompt sensitivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitor Analysis.</strong> We log which brands get recommended for each query, what position they appear in, and what sources the AI cites when recommending them. This creates a competitive landscape map showing exactly who dominates your category in AI recommendations and how consistently they appear across platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Source Mapping.</strong> We trace every AI citation back to its original source. These include web pages, review sites, Reddit threads, Wikipedia and Wikidata entries, structured data feeds, and third-party comparison pages. Source mapping reveals exactly what content and data is driving AI recommendations in your category.</li>
        <li><strong>Gap Analysis Report.</strong> We compile everything into a detailed report showing where you currently stand, which competitors dominate and why, and the specific content gaps preventing AI from recommending you. Every gap is ranked by revenue potential, giving you a prioritized roadmap for implementation.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What You Get</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complete AI visibility audit</strong> showing your recommendation rate across all major platforms</li>
        <li><strong>Competitor comparison</strong> showing who AI recommends instead of you and why</li>
        <li><strong>Source map</strong> identifying exactly which content and data sources drive AI recommendations in your category</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritized roadmap</strong> ranking opportunities by revenue potential</li>
        <li><strong>Measurable baseline</strong> for tracking improvement as you implement the remaining 6 layers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
      <p>A B2B SaaS company in the project management space ran an answer intent audit. Out of 50 relevant AI queries, they appeared in 3 recommendations. Their top competitor appeared in 38.</p>
      <p>The source map revealed the competitor had a comprehensive comparison page that AI cited in 70% of responses, a Wikidata entry with structured facts about the product, and 15+ third-party review site mentions with detailed feature breakdowns. The SaaS company had none of these.</p>
      <p>Within 90 days of implementing layers 2 through 6 based on the audit findings, they went from 3 to 41 AI recommendations out of 50 queries. The audit did not just show them the problem. It gave them the exact blueprint for fixing it.</p>

      <h2>How This Connects to the Full System</h2>
      <p>Answer Intent Mapping informs everything that follows. The queries identified in Layer 1 determine what content goes into the Answer Hub (Layer 2), what facts go on the Brand Facts page (Layer 3), what structured data to implement (Layers 4 and 5), and what third-party sources to target (Layer 6). Without this layer, you are guessing at what to build and which gaps to close.</p>
