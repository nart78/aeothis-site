      <!-- TL;DR -->
      <div class="tldr-box animate-on-scroll">
        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <p>A Brand Facts page is a clean, Wikipedia-style page containing every verifiable fact about your business: founding year, founders, headquarters, certifications, product specs, pricing, social profiles, and key policies. AI assistants run verification checks before making recommendations. When they can easily find and verify facts about your company, they recommend you with higher confidence. This page reduces the risk of AI hallucinating incorrect information about your brand.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- What Is a Brand Facts Page? -->
      <h2>What Is a Brand Facts Page?</h2>
      <p>A Brand Facts page is a structured, factual page that serves as the canonical source of truth about your business. Unlike a typical About page that tells your story, the Brand Facts page presents hard data in a format optimized for machine readability.</p>
      <p>Think of it as a Wikipedia infobox for your company. It lists every verifiable data point in a clean, labeled format that both humans and AI can scan in seconds. Company name, founding year, headquarters, certifications, service areas, pricing, social profiles. All in one place.</p>
      <p>AI assistants need to verify claims before recommending a business. When an AI is deciding whether to recommend you, it looks for facts it can cross-reference. The Brand Facts page makes that verification instant. No digging through paragraphs of marketing copy. No piecing together scattered data from multiple pages. Just clean, structured, verifiable facts.</p>

      <!-- Why It Matters -->
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI assistants verify before recommending.</strong> If they cannot find basic facts (founding year, location, certifications), they lower their confidence in recommending you. Missing data is a signal that the business may not be established or trustworthy enough to recommend.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduces AI hallucination risk.</strong> When AI cannot find facts, it sometimes generates plausible-sounding but incorrect information. A Brand Facts page gives AI accurate data to cite instead of guessing. You control the narrative by providing the source material.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency across platforms.</strong> When your facts are in one canonical location, all AI platforms pull the same accurate information. No more conflicting data between ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude.</li>
        <li><strong>Signals transparency and authority.</strong> A comprehensive Brand Facts page shows that your business has nothing to hide. Sparse company data is a red flag for AI recommendation systems. Detailed, verifiable data is a trust signal.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Our Process -->
      <h2>Our Process</h2>

      <div class="process__steps">

          <div class="process__step-num">1</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Fact Compilation</h3>
            <p>We gather every factual data point about your business: founding year, founders, headquarters, employee count, certifications, awards, product specs, service areas, pricing ranges, social profiles, and key policies. If it is verifiable and relevant to AI trust signals, it goes on the list.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="process__step animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="process__step-num">2</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Wikipedia-Style Layout</h3>
            <p>We structure the page with a floating infobox (like a Wikipedia sidebar) containing key facts at a glance, followed by detailed sections for products and services, history, certifications, and contact information. The layout is designed so AI can extract specific data points without parsing narrative text.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="process__step animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="process__step-num">3</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Structured Data Embedding</h3>
            <p>Every fact gets encoded in Organization schema markup in the page header. This gives AI two access methods: readable HTML for crawlers that parse page content, and structured JSON-LD for systems that read metadata directly. Double coverage means no fact gets missed.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="process__step animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="process__step-num">4</div>
          <div>
            <h3>External Verification Links</h3>
            <p>We link facts to external proof: certification bodies, BBB profiles, government registrations, and industry directories. When AI can cross-reference your claims against third-party sources, it builds significantly more trust than self-reported data alone.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="process__step animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="process__step-num">5</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Regular Updates</h3>
            <p>Brand Facts is a living document. New awards, key hires, product launches, pricing changes, and updated certifications all get added as they happen. Stale data erodes AI trust over time, so we establish an ongoing update protocol to keep everything current.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- What You Get -->
      <h2>What You Get</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A fully built Brand Facts page</strong> with Wikipedia-style infobox layout designed for both human visitors and AI crawlers</li>
        <li><strong>Complete fact compilation</strong> covering all verifiable business data, from founding details to certifications to pricing</li>
        <li><strong>Embedded Organization schema markup</strong> for machine readability, giving AI structured JSON-LD alongside the visible page content</li>
        <li><strong>External verification links</strong> connecting your claims to third-party proof sources like certification bodies, directories, and registrations</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing update protocol</strong> so the page stays current as your business evolves, preventing stale data from eroding AI trust</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced hallucination risk</strong> by giving AI accurate, structured data to cite instead of generating guesses about your business</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Real-World Example -->
      <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
      <p>A professional services firm noticed AI assistants were giving incorrect information about their founding year, office locations, and service areas. Sometimes the AI would confuse them with a similarly named competitor. Prospects were arriving with wrong expectations, and the firm was losing deals before the first conversation even started.</p>
      <p>We built a Brand Facts page with verified data and Organization schema. Every key fact was labeled, structured, and linked to external verification sources. Within 4 weeks, AI responses about the firm became accurate. Their recommendation rate increased from 8 to 29 out of 50 queries, partly because AI could now verify their credentials before recommending them. The hallucination problem disappeared entirely.</p>

      <!-- How This Connects -->
      <h2>How This Connects</h2>
      <p>Brand Facts works alongside the <a href="/services/answer-hub-creation.html">Answer Hub (Layer 2)</a> to create a complete picture. While the Answer Hub provides the recommendation narrative, the Brand Facts page provides the verification data. AI uses both: the Answer Hub to understand why you are worth recommending, and the Brand Facts page to confirm the claims are accurate.</p>
      <p>The facts on this page also feed into the <a href="/services/machine-readable-data.html">Machine-Readable Data file (Layer 4)</a> and <a href="/services/schema-markup.html">Schema Markup (Layer 5)</a>. The structured JSON and schema markup encode the same facts in formats AI can process programmatically. <a href="/services/citation-building.html">Third-party citations (Layer 6)</a> become more effective when AI can cross-reference them against your Brand Facts. Every layer reinforces the others.</p>
